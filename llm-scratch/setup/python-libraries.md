# Python Libraries

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, after completing the installation, pls check if all the packages are installed and are up to date using

```bash
python python_env_check.py
```

It's also recommended to check the versions in JupyterLab by running the following command:

```bash

```
